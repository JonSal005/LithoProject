          <p>Lithotripsy is a medical treatment by which kidney stone or other calculus is broken into small particles that can be passed out by the body.</p>
          <p>Lithotripsy is the most common treatment in the US for kidney stones.</p>
          <p>Kidney stones form when your urine contains more crystal-forming substances — such as calcium, oxalate and uric acid — than the fluid in your urine can dilute.</p>
        <p>Kidney stones affect aproximately 1 in 10 people in the US every year. Each year, more than half a million people go to emergency rooms for kidney stone problems.</p>

          <p>There are several different types of Lithotripsy procedures:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Extra Corporeal Shockwave Lithotripsy</li>
            <li>Laser Lithotripsy</li>
            <li>Ultrasonic Lithotripsy</li>
            <li>Electrohydraulic Lithotripsy</li>
            <li>Robotic Assisted Kidney Stone Removal</li>
               </ul>
               <p>There are multiple determining factors that go into which type of Lithotripsy procedure is used, including stone size, stone location within the body/ureter, and stone density.</p>

          <header>Extra Corporeal Shockwave Lithotripsy</header>
          <p>Extra Corporeal Shockwave Lithotripsy (ESWL) is a procedure to break up stones inside the urinary tract, bile ducts or pancreatic duct with a series of shockwaves generated by a machine called a lithotripter.</p>
          <p>ESWL is one of the most common forms of lithotripsy, with success rates of 60-99%. The procedure is completely non-invasive.</p>

          <header>Modulith SLX F2 Lithotripter</header>
          <p>One of the most common Lithotripters used to perform ESWL surgeries is the Modulith SLX F2.</p>
          <p>There are specific parameters used with the Lithotripter in order to treat kidney stones, for example:</p>
          <code>Shocks:2400</code>
          <code>Energy:3.0</code>
          <code>Focal Spot:Precise</code>
          <code>Hz:1.5</code>

        <section class="main-section" id="Laser_Lithotripsy">
          <header>Laser Lithotripsy</header>
          <p>Holmium Laser Lithotripsy is a procedure in which a flexible laser fiber is inserted through a scope (camera) placed in the urinary tract via the urethra to break up the stones. The stone fragments are then removed with a small basket or other instruments.</p>
          <p>Laser Lithotripsy is one of the most common forms of lithotripsy, with success rates of 50-92.9%. The procedure is done without any incisions.</p>

          <header>Holmium YAG Laser</header>
          <p>One of the most common Urology Lasers used to perform Laser Lithotripsy surgeries is the Holmium YAG Laser</p>
          <p>There are specific parameters used with the Laser in order to treat kidney stones, for example:</p>
          <code>Watts/Avg.Pwr:6.4</code>
          <code>Hz:8</code>
          <code>Energy(Joules):0.8</code>
          <code>Total Energy Used:650</code>
